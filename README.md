# Broadcast a Basic Video Chat

This series of tutorials will explore the [Vonage Video API (formerly TokBox OpenTok)](https://tokbox.com/developer/) and what you can build with it. The Video API is very robust and highly customizable, and in each post, weâ€™ll show how to implement a specific feature using the API. This time we will look at how to broadcast your video chat to many viewers online.

We will not be using any front-end frameworks for this series, just vanilla Javascript to keep the focus on the Video API itself. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to broadcast your video chat live to a large audience using HTTP live streaming (HLS) or an RTMP stream.
